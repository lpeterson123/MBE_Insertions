I need to know about enzymes and energy. I need to be able to explain diagrams (e.g. Calvin Cycle, Krebs Cycle, factors effective photosynthesis etc).]\nNot only do I need to learn this material, but I would also like to periodically take metacognition breaks where I will prompt you to help me think about my thinking so I can 1) better learn and recall this information and also 2) learn new concepts more deeply and efficiently in the future."
